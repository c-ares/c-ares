.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ares_getaddrinfo
function initiates a host query by name on the name service channel
identified by
.IR channel .
The parameter
.I name
gives the hostname as a NUL-terminated C string, and
.I hints->ai_family
gives the desired type of address for the resulting addrinfo result list.
The parameter
.I service
and the other properties from the
.I hints
parameter are ignored. When the
query is complete or has failed, the ares library will invoke \fIcallback\fP.
Completion or failure of the query may happen immediately, or may happen
during a later call to \fIares_process(3)\fP, \fIares_destroy(3)\fP or
\fIares_cancel(3)\fP.
.PP
The callback argument
.I arg
is copied from the
.B ares_getaddrinfo
argument
.IR arg .
The callback argument
.I status
indicates whether the query succeeded and, if not, how it failed.  It
may have any of the following values:
.TP 19
.B ARES_SUCCESS
The host lookup completed successfully.
.TP 19
.B ARES_ENOTIMP
The ares library does not know how to find addresses of type
.IR family .
.TP 19
.B ARES_ENOTFOUND
The name
.I name
was not found.
.TP 19
.B ARES_ENOMEM
Memory was exhausted.
.TP 19
.B ARES_ECANCELLED
The query was cancelled.
.TP 19
.B ARES_EDESTRUCTION
The name service channel
.I channel
is being destroyed; the query will not be completed.
.PP
On successful completion of the query, the callback argument
.I result
points to a
.B struct addrinfo
which is a linked list, where each item contains family and address of
the requested name. The list is not sorted. The reserved memory has to be
deleted by
.B ares_freeaddrinfo.

.SH CAVEATS
This function is under development. It only supports a minimum feature set
of the function
.B getaddrinfo
defined in RFC-3493. It also does not support the destination address selection
algorithm defined in RFC-6724.
